## User Benefits

1. **Faster Task Management**
   - Complete tasks in 2 clicks instead of opening Jira
   - Change status without context switching

2. **Workflow Flexibility**
   - Works with any Jira workflow
   - Automatically shows only available transitions
   - Respects workflow rules and permissions

3. **Better UX**
   - Confirmation dialogs prevent mistakes
   - Auto-refresh keeps data current
   - Clear error messages
   - Organized action panel

4. **Keyboard-First**
   - All actions have keyboard shortcuts
   - Fast navigation through tasks
   - No mouse required

## Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Jira Cloud
- ‚úÖ All Jira workflows
- ‚úÖ Custom status transitions
- ‚úÖ Permission-aware
- ‚ùå Jira Server/Data Center (not supported)

## Known Limitations

1. **No Custom Transition Fields**
   - If a transition requires additional fields (e.g., resolution, comment), it may fail
   - Workaround: Open in Jira for complex transitions

2. **"Mark as Done" Matching**
   - Requires transition or target status to contain "done" or "complete"
   - If your workflow uses different names, use "Change Status" instead

3. **Refresh Timing**
   - Small delay before tasks disappear from list
   - This is normal - Jira needs time to process the change

## Upgrade Instructions

The extension is already running in dev mode, so the changes are live!

**To verify:**
1. Open Raycast
2. Go to Review Tasks
3. Check if new keyboard shortcuts work
4. Look for "Mark as Done" and "Change Status" in actions

**If not working:**
1. Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. Run `npm run dev` again
3. Try Review Tasks command
